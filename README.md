# Decision-Tree
- Regressor and Classifier 

- Implement DT on given dataset. You need to tune the hyperparameters as to minimize the RMSE or Accuracy. 
- Use graphviz (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/graphviz)  to print your final, tuned tree. 
  To go over any theory, look at the Decision Tree section of ISLR.
